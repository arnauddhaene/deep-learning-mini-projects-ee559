###### EE-559 Deep Learning (EPFL), spring 2021

A more extended version of Project 1 is available in the sister folder `Proj1-extended`. It uses libraries that are not allowed for official submission, but implements interesting aspects like automatic figure generation, modern argparsing for running tests, and hyper-parameter grid-search.

## Running `Proj1`

As enforced in the project description, you can train and test our best performing model using
