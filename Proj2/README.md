# Project 2 - Mini deep-learning framework

###### EE-559 Deep Learning (EPFL), spring 2021

## Running `Proj2`

As enforced in the project description, you can train and test our best performing model using

```bash
python test.py
```

We have built a python package called `flame` that uses a very familiar structure (inspired from PyTorch). We import `from torch import Tensor` only for type hints, as allowed by the TAs in a Slack message.
